# Jets Project

A [Ruby on Jets](https://rubyonjets.com/) application to generate a web page with a random background color. See it in action at https://b4jics14dk.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/. The page is created and served via a AWS Lambda function!

Some of these commands were useful

- `jets generate controller random_background_color index`
- `jets serve`
